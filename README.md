The idea of this project is to use various stochastic methods to:
- Find pairs (for now) of stocks that historically have the same trends
    - What is the optimal time window for this? Guess we'll find out.
    - 'The same trend' is a pair of stocks which reject the hypothesis test: 'Two stocks, S1 and S2, are cointegrated' with a p-value < 0.05.
